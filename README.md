The SIM7020 is Multi-Band NB-IoT module solution in a SMT type . It has strong extension capability with rich interfaces including UART, GPIO etc. The module provides much flexibility and ease of integration for customer's application. The package of SIM7020 is compatible with SIM800C. This also minimizes the investments of customers, and enables a short time-to-market.
It is designed for applications that need low latency, Low throughput data communication in a variety of radio propagation conditions. Due to the unique combination of performance, security and flexibility, this module is ideally suited for M2M applications, such as metering, asset tracking, remote monitoring , E-health etc..

Investment in diffusion by free innovators can increase social wel-
fare because it is often the case that even relatively small investments
can greatly reduce search and adoption costs for many free riders. For
example, if I, as a free innovation developer, would invest just a little
extra effort to document my open source software code more clearly, I
could greatly reduce the time that perhaps thousands of adopters would
require to install and use my novel code. Intuitively, it would seem that
there would be a net increase in social welfare if I were to expend just
that small extra effort. ( - Free Innovation p. 66 von Hippel)
