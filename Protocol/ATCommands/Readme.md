The AT command set is divided into four classes:

basic command set
This set contains the basic commands, e.g. hang up handset, set volume. The commands consist of the character string AT followed by a letter and possibly subsequent digits. Upper/lower case is irrelevant, since these characters only differ in one bit in ASCII and this bit is ignored.
Example: ATD1234 means: Attention, dial the phone number 1234.
extended or enhanced command set
This is the extended command set (hardware-related settings, such as modem test or data compression). The commands consist of an AT&, AT+, AT% or AT* followed by a letter and possibly a digit.
special command set
Special commands
register command set
Commands that act directly on the register set.
ATS2? returns the value from register 2
ATS2=6 assigns the value 6 to register 2
